# S14/15A Data creation
There five types of images are there in the dataset. They are
* Background 
* Foreground
* Foreground mask images
* FG_BG
* FG_BG masks

### Foreground images
* The Foreground images are downloaded from the internet. I downloaded 100 **parrot** images. 
* And another 100 images are created by flipping and transposing.
* So there are 200  images are there now

### Background images
* There are 100 **house and shop** images are downloaded from internet.

### Foreground mask images
* I used the GIMP application to create the foreground mask images.
* First i deleted the background and filed with black color by using Selection tool.
* After that i filled with black color(CTRL + ,).
* And inverse seletion(CTRL I) of image will select the foreground and filled with white color(CTRL + .)
* The shortcuts are very useful in GIMP.
