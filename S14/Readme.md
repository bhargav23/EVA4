### Foreground mask images
* I used the GIMP application to create the foreground mask images.
* First i deleted the background and filed with black color by using Selection tool.
* After that i filled with black color(CTRL + ,).
* And inverse seletion(CTRL I) of image will select the foreground and filled with white color(CTRL + .)
* The shortcuts are very useful in GIMP.
