# S4
## Strategy
* Total number of parameters is 18,058. 
* To improve the accuracy, I added the Batch normalization and drop out after every convolution layer but not in the last layer.
* The drop out rate is set to 15% and reduced it 10% later in the layers. The dropout is used to regulralize the neural networks and prevents the overfitting.
* I experimented the network in tow ways. First i used 2 Max Pooling layer and then i used only one Max pooling layer.
* When i used two max pooling layers the acuracy 99.44, when i used only layer then the acuracy is 99.42. 
* I uloaded both files. 
* After checking several models, accuracy is increased to 99.44.
