# S4
## Strategy
* To improve the accuracy, I added the Batch normalization and drop out after every convolution layer but not in the last layer.
* The drop out rate is set to 15% and reduced it 10% later in the layers. The dropout is used to regulralize the neural networks and prevents the overfitting.
* After checking several models, accuracy is increased to 99.44.
